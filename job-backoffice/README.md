# 🏢 Job Backoffice - Admin & Cpmpany Manager Portal

## 📖 Project Overview
**Job Backoffice** is the administrative command center of the **Job Vacancies Platform**. It serves as the operational hub for **System Administrators** and **Company Owners/HR Managers**.

While the *Job App* focuses on the candidate experience, the **Backoffice** is dedicated to content management, operational oversight, and decision-making. It ensures that job listings are accurate, applications are processed efficiently, and the platform remains secure and organized.

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Mechanism
* **Centralized Control:** A single dashboard to manage Users, Companies, and Jobs.
* **RBAC & OBAC:** Implements **Role-Based Access Control** (Admins vs. Owners) and **Ownership-Based Access Control** (Owners can only manage their own companies/jobs).
* **Data Integrity:** Acts as the gatekeeper for the data displayed on the public Job App.

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Architecture
This project operates within a **Monorepo** ecosystem, sharing the core domain logic with the `job-app`.

### Key Architectural Concepts

  * **Shared Models:** Uses `../job-shared` for Eloquent Models (`Company`, `JobVacancy`, `JobApplication`) to ensure data consistency across the platform.
  * **Blade Components:** Utilizes reusable UI components for standardized Admin tables, modals, and alerts.
  * **Soft Deletes:** Implements non-destructive deletion for Companies, Jobs, and Users to maintain historical data.
