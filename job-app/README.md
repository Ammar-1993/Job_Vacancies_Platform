# 🚀 Job App - Candidate Portal

## 📖 Project Overview
**Job App** is the public-facing interface of the **Job Vacancies Platform**. It is a modern, responsive web application designed specifically for **Job Seekers**.

The primary objective of this application is to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity by providing a seamless, AI-enhanced recruitment experience. Unlike traditional job boards, **Job App** integrates **Artificial Intelligence** to analyze candidate resumes in real-time, providing compatibility scores and actionable feedback before an application reaches the employer.

---

## ⚙️ Mechanism of Action
1. **Browse:** Candidates search and filter job vacancies fetched from the central database.
2. **Apply:** Users submit applications by uploading their Resume (PDF).
3. **Analyze:** The system (via Background Queues) parses the resume using **OpenAI**, comparing skills against the job description.
4. **Feedback:** The candidate receives an AI-generated compatibility score and tips for improvement.

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Architecture
This project operates within a **Monorepo** ecosystem, sharing resources with the `job-backoffice`.

### Key Architectural Concepts

  * **Shared Kernel:** The application relies on `../job-shared` for Eloquent Models (`User`, `JobVacancy`, `Resume`) and Enums to ensure a **Single Source of Truth**.
  * **Secure Storage:** Resumes are stored in a private disk (`storage/app/resumes`) to ensure GDPR compliance and user privacy.
  * **UUIDs:** All primary keys use UUIDs for enhanced security and scalability.

-----

## 💻 Operating Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the following specifications before installation:

  * **PHP:** Version 8.2 or higher.
  * **Database:** MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.10+ (Dockerized).
  * **Extensions:** `BCMath`, `Ctype`, `Fileinfo`, `JSON`, `Mbstring`, `OpenSSL`, `PDO`, `Tokenizer`, `XML`.
  * **Composer:** Latest version.
  * **Node.js & NPM:** For compiling frontend assets.
  * **OpenAI API Key:** For the AI analysis features.

## 🛠️ Installation & Commissioning

Follow these steps to get the project running from scratch.

### 1\. Clone & Navigate

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Ammar-1993/Job_Vacancies_Platform.git](https://github.com/Ammar-1993/Job_Vacancies_Platform.git)
cd Job_Vacancies_Platform/job-app
```

### 2\. Install Backend Dependencies

*Since this app depends on `job-shared`, ensure the path is accessible.*

```bash
composer install
composer dump-autoload
```

### 3\. Environment Configuration

Duplicate the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your configuration:

```dotenv
APP_NAME="Job App"
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Database (Must match Docker Container credentials)
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=jobs_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root

# OpenAI Integration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

### 4\. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 5\. Link Storage

Create the symbolic link for public assets (Images/CSS), while keeping resumes private.

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 6\. Run the Application

```bash
php artisan serve
```

> The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8000).

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions\! Please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a **Feature Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).

## ❓ Common Issues & Solutions

### 🔴 Error: Class "App\\Models\\User" not found

  * **Cause:** The application cannot locate the models in the shared folder.
  * **Solution:** Ensure your `composer.json` has the correct path mapped in autoload and run:
    ```bash
    composer dump-autoload
    ```

### 🔴 Error: 403 Forbidden on Resume Upload

  * **Cause:** Permissions on the storage folder.
  * **Solution:** Ensure the storage and bootstrap/cache directories are writable:
    ```bash
    chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
    ```

### 🔴 Error: Database Connection Refused

  * **Cause:** Docker container might not be running or port mapping is incorrect.
  * **Solution:** Check Docker status and ensure `DB_PORT` in `.env` matches your Docker configuration (default `3306`).

## 💡 Feedback & Tips

### 👤 For Users

  * **Resume Format:** Ensure your resume is in **PDF format** and does not exceed **2MB**.
  * **Content:** To get the best AI score, ensure your resume text is **selectable** (not an image scan).

### 👨‍💻 For Developers

  * **Queues:** The AI analysis runs in the background. Ensure you run the queue worker locally to process resume analysis jobs:
    ```bash
    php artisan queue:work
    ```
  * **Security:** Never commit your `.env` file or `OPENAI_API_KEY` to version control.
